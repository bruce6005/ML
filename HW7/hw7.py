# part 1.1  PCA LDA show first 25 eigen and fisher random 10 images and reconstruct
# part 1.2  reconstruction and performance k-nn to classify
# part 1.3  kernel PCA and kernel LDA do face recognization 
#           choose different kernel RBF XX^t
# part 2.1  t-SNE reference code given 
# modify it to becone symmetric SNE
# part 2.2  visualize embedding of both method
# part 2.3  visualize distribution of 
# pairwise similarities in both 
# high-dimensional space and low-dimensional space
# part 2.4 try different perplexity values
